pdx.lua: useful extensions to pd.lua
Copyright (C) 2020 Albert Gr√§f <aggraef@gmail.com>

To use this in your pd-lua scripts: local pdx = require 'pdx'

Currently there's only the pdx.reload() function, which implements a kind of
remote reload functionality based on dofile and receivers, as explained in the
pd-lua tutorial. More may be added in the future.

Reload functionality. Call pdx.reload() on your object to enable, and
pdx.unreload() to disable this functionality again.

pdx.reload installs a "pdluax" receiver which reloads the object's script file
when it receives the "reload" message without any arguments, or a "reload
class" message with a matching class name.

We have to go to some lengths here since we only want the script to be
reloaded *once* for each class, not for every object in the class. This
complicates things quite a bit. In particular, we need to keep track of object
deletions to perform the necessary bookkeeping, in order to ensure that at any
time there's exactly one participating object in the class which receives the
message. Which means that we also need to keep track of the object's finalize
method, so that we can chain to it in our own finalizer.

      -- original finalizer
