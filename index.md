**pd-lua** is Claude Heiland-Allen's [Pd][] loader extension for the [Lua][] scripting language.

This is a fork of [umlaeute's repository](https://anonscm.debian.org/git/pkg-multimedia/pd-lua.git), from which the official Debian pd-lua packages are built. It adds Lua 5.3+ compatibility, support for [Purr Data][] (a modern flavor of Pd), some compilation fixes to make sure that the source builds on current systems (Linux, macOS, Windows), and, last but not least, a [tutorial][] to help you get started using pd-lua. Released source tarballs and binaries for Mac and Windows can be found [here](https://github.com/agraef/pd-lua/releases).
