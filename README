NOTES by aggraef: This works with all Pd flavors out there and makes Pd
external programming incredibly easy (please check the included examples).
Originally written by Claude Heiland-Allen, pdlua has gone through the hands
of many people over the years, including mrpeach, umlaeute (responsible for
the Debian package) and myself (Arch package, Lua 5.3 support). Since the
contents of the original README has become rather outdated, I've updated the
information below.


Lua 5.3 is highly recommended, older versions are untested and unsupported -
use at your own risk.


Compilation Instructions:

The source should compile out of the box on (at least) Linux, macOS and
Windows, just make sure that you have Lua and Pd installed and run `make`.
Ready-to-use binaries for the older Lua 5.2 version are available from Deken.
The latest (Lua 5.3) binaries are on https://github.com/agraef/pd-lua.

If you want/need to compile from source, the following details the
requirements for the three most popular platforms.

Linux:

Both Lua 5.3 and Pd should be available in your package repositories, if not
then they're easy to install from source, cf. https://www.lua.org/download.html
and http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html.

macOS/OS X:

Lua 5.3 is available in Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) and MacPorts
(https://www.macports.org/), but it's also easy to install from source once
you have XCode up and running. As distributed, the build requires that you
have the Pd header files somewhere under /Applications/Pd-*/Contents
/Resources/include (which should be the case if you're running a recent Pd
distribution by MSP); otherwise you may have to set the `PD_INCLUDE` make
variable accordingly.

Windows:

Compilation is a breeze using mingw (either the old one at http://mingw.org/
or the new msys2-based installation at http://www.msys2.org/). The Lua that
ships with msys2 is still 5.2 at the time of this writing, so you'll want to
compile Lua 5.3 from source and install it in the mingw environment using
`make install`. The build also assumes that you have a recent Pd installation
as distributed by MSP, please check the comments in the mingw section of the
Makefile for details. This is necessary so that the header files and pd.dll
are found during compilation and linkage, respectively.

Installation:

After a successful compile, you can go about installing the external with the
usual `make install` (which copies the external to its own directory named
pdlua). This should generally do something sensible on each of the supported
platforms. Note that the installation may require root privileges.

Linux: By default, installation goes into /usr/local/lib/pd-externals, which
should be one of the directories on Pd's search path.

macOS/OS X: Installation goes into ~/Library/Pd by default. Move the pdlua
folder to /Library/Pd for a system-wide installation.

Windows/mingw: Installation goes into the extra subdirectory of your Pd
installation, so it will be available to all users by default.

It's generally advisable to do a staged install using `DESTDIR` first so that
you can review the installation directory layout beforehand and adjust it if
needed. To these ends, run `make install`, e.g., as follows:

    make install DESTDIR=$PWD/BUILD

This will leave the installed external in a folder BUILD inside the current
directory from where you can move the pdlua subdirectory to any location on
Pd's library search path that you see fit.

Finally, having finished installation, to enable pd-lua in Pd just add `pdlua`
to your startup libraries (after adding its parent directory to Pd's search
path if necessary) and you should be set.
